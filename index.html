            <p>
                A sustainable home is an efficient home that's built or retrofitted in a way that respects resources, optimizes energy and water use, and will last longer with quality systems. Sustainable homes use low-impact, high-performance materials. They're efficient in terms of manufacturing, shipping and installing.

                What is a Traditional Home? Traditional home designs are inspired by 18th and 19th-century European décor. It is a timeless style that exemplifies elegance and comfort. The traditional home is perfect for those who love antiques, classic art pieces, symmetry and other design elements that are rich with history.
